Software design project for The Gaming Room - CS 230
1. Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to expand their existing Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a distributed web-based application. They needed a solution that could run across multiple platforms, be scalable to support many users, and maintain performance and responsiveness for real-time gameplay. The focus was on designing a cloud-capable, cross-platform version of their game.
2. What I Did Well
I did particularly well in organizing the software design document to clearly outline the system requirements, design constraints, and the recommended architecture for the new platform. I provided a strong breakdown of how the game could scale and how different components would interact in a distributed environment.
3. Helpful Process While Working Through the Design
Working through the design process helped me think carefully about the structure of the application before starting any code development. It forced me to consider system requirements, user needs, and platform challenges early on, which made the entire project feel more focused and achievable.
4. What I Would Revise
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the evaluation section by adding more detailed comparisons between alternative design approaches. This would make the recommendation section even stronger and help the client see why the chosen design was the best fit.
5. Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I focused on user needs by prioritizing scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and responsiveness in the design. Considering user needs is important because the application must be intuitive, fast, and reliable for a large number of players in real-time, or it risks losing engagement and satisfaction.
6. Future Approach for Software Design
In the future, I would continue using structured design processes but also incorporate more visual diagrams and early prototyping. Techniques like using UML diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes would help communicate ideas more clearly and align client expectations even earlier in the project.
